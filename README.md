### Welcome

Welcome to the **Half Lab** at **King's College London**. We are a multidisciplinary research group focused on advancing neuroimaging methods and their application to brain development, health, and disease, with a particular emphasis on **ultra-low-field (ULF) MRI** and equitable global research.

Our work spans methodological development, quantitative analysis, and translational research, aiming to make advanced neuroimaging tools more accessible and reproducible across diverse settings.

### Research Themes

* Ultra-low-field MRI acquisition, reconstruction, and super-resolution
* Structural similarity networks and brain connectivity
* Reproducibility and reliability of neuroimaging measures
* Neurodevelopment across diverse populations
* Open, scalable, and reproducible neuroimaging workflows

### News

* **November 2025** – Lab member *Ula* joined the group!
* **September 2025** - Paper accepted to Imaging Neuroscience https://doi.org/10.1162/IMAG.a.930
* **September 2025** – Levi won first place in the MICCAI 2025 Challenge: Enhancing Ultra-Low-Field MRI with Paired High-Field MRI Comparisons for Brain Imaging (ULF-EnC)
